  \chapter{Method}\label{chapter:method}
  This chapter outlines the method used to construct a finite difference scheme for the deterministic Jump Growth Equation, \autoref{eq:mvf:diffusion}. It begins with a discussion about the steady state of the McKendrick-von Foerster Equation and how this helps to solve the Jump Growth Equation. Following this we apply the mathematics in \autoref{chapter:fdes} and \cite{rosinger2008} to construct a finite difference scheme that is stable and consistent, and thus convergent.


  \section{Steady State Solutions}\label{sec:met:steadystate}
  In marine ecosystems it's been found that the abundance of organisms within weight classes is roughly constant (\cite{sheldon1972}) if those weight classes are distributed logarithmically. Further, averaged over time, this abundance changes rather little (\cite{datta2011}) suggesting that the system is near steady state. \cite{benoit2004} found that the McKendrick-von Foerster Equation has a power law steady steady state of the form $\phi(w) \propto w^{\gamma}$. We combine this reasearch to now show that the the McKendrick-von Foerster Equation with diffusion (\autoref{eq:mvf:diffusion}) can be transformed using the logarithmic change of variables and appropriate change of function to have a constant solution if the work of \cite{benoit2004} is correct.

  \subsection{Logarithmic Weight Index}
  It first helps to transform to a dimensionless variable $x = \log{w}$, with $\varphi(x) \mathrm{d}x = \phi(w) \mathrm{d}w$ which we will show makes our equations behave much more nicely under translation. First let us consider the feeding kernel function $S$ (\autoref{eq:mvf:feedgaussian}), from which we can construct a new $\hat{S}(x) = S(\mathrm{e}^x)$ and substitute this in to the growth, death and diffusion functions (along with our change of variables and function) to get new functions $\hat{g}, \hat{\mu}, \hat{D}$ that satisfy
  \begin{equation}
    \varphi_t = - (\hat{g} \cdot \varphi)_x - \hat{\mu} \cdot \varphi + \frac{\e{-x}}{2}\left(( \hat{D}\cdot \varphi)_{xx} - (\hat{D} \cdot \varphi)_x \right).
  \end{equation}

  These functions have the form
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \hat{g}(x) &=& \int K \e{x' + (\alpha - 1)x} \hat{S}(x - x') \varphi(x') \: \mathrm{d}x' \\
    \hat{D}(x) &=& \int K^2 \e{2x' + (\alpha - 1)x} \hat{S}(x - x') \varphi(x') \: \mathrm{d}x' \\
    \hat{\mu}(x) &=& \int K \e{\alpha x'} \hat{S}(x' - x) \varphi(x') \: \mathrm{d}x'
  \end{eqnarray}

  and yield a steady state distribution that $\varphi(x) \propto \e{\gamma + 1}$. Finally by substituting in $\rho(x) = \e{\gamma} \varphi(x)$ we should yield a system which has a steady state $\rho(x) \propto 1$. This substitution gains the coefficients

  \begin{eqnarray}
    \bar{g}(x) &=& \int K \e{(\alpha + 1)x'} \hat{S}(x - x') \rho(x') \: \mathrm{d}x' \\
    \bar{D}(x) &=& \int K \e{(\alpha + 1)x'} \hat{S}(x - x') \rho(x') \: \mathrm{d}x' \\
    \bar{\mu}(x) &=& \e{\gamma x}\int K \e{(\alpha + 1)x'} \hat{S}(x - x') \rho(x') \: \mathrm{d}x'
  \end{eqnarray}
