  \chapter{Method}\label{chapter:method}

  In this chapter we begin by considering finite difference equations for the McKendrick-von Foerster Equation with constant coefficients instead of the non-linear equations seen to be created using the Jump-Growth Equation.

  \section{Constant Coefficients}
  The obvious starting point when studying any PDE problem is to study the case of constant coefficients as a starting point. If we take \autoref{theory:eq:jumptransport} with $g, \mu$ and $D$ constant then we have a a very simple equation to discretize and study:

  \begin{equation}
    u_t = - g \cdot u_w - \mu \cdot u + \frac{D}{2} u_{ww}.
  \end{equation}
