When considering hyperbolic partial differential equation problems it is important to consider the steady state solutions, that is if $\partial_t u = \mathcal{L}u$ the solutions for which $\mathcal{L}u = 0$. Thus we investigate the problem for when the Growth-Diffusion Equation (\autoref{eq:mvf:diffusion}).

\cite{benoit2004} first showed that the McKendrick Von Foerster Equation has a steady state solution of the power law form $\hat{\phi}(w) \propto w^{\alpha}$, and \cite{datta2010} shows that this is also true for the Jump Growth Equation.

\subsection{Construction of Growth-Diffusion Equation}
In Section~\ref{sec:mvf:relation} we defined the Growth-Diffusion Equation as an approximation to the Jump-Growth Equation. We will now study this equation on it's own, disregarding the remainder term, and show that it's form is similar to a non-linear advection-diffusion transport equation. Thus we can define the growth, predation and diffusion coefficients on their own, allowing us to study the steady states.

Consider The Growth-Diffusion Equation rewritten so that we have
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial \phi(w)}{\partial t}
  &=& \phi(w) \left( \int k(w', w) \phi(w') \: \mathrm{d}w' \right) \nonumber \\
  && -  \frac{\partial}{\partial w} \left( \phi(w)  \int K w' k(w, w')\phi(w') \: \mathrm{d}w' \right) \nonumber \\
  && + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial w} \left( \phi(w) \int (K w')^2 k(w, w')\phi(w')  \: \mathrm{d}w' \right).
\end{eqnarray}

This is analogous to writing
\begin{equation}\label{eq:met:transport}
  \partial_t \phi(w) = \mu(w) \phi(w) - \partial_w(G(w) \phi(w)) - \frac{1}{2} \partial_{ww} ( D(w) \phi(w)),
\end{equation}

where we have the coefficients $G, \mu, D$ are functions of $w$, with dependece on $\phi$. \cite{benoit2004} showed that the McKendrick von Foerster Equation has a steady state solution of the form
\begin{equation}
  \phi(w) \propto w^{\alpha}
\end{equation}

and further \cite{datta2010} showed that the Equation~\ref{eq:met:transport} has a steady state of the same form.

\subsection{Steady State Analysis}
\cite{datta2011} gives a detailed investigation in to the steady state solutions of Equation~\ref{eq:met:transport}. Here we give a construction of the dimensionless form of Equation~\ref{eq:met:transport}, which has a constant steady state and therefore is easier the analytically argue is true.

It first helps to transform to a dimensionless variable $x = \log{w}$ such that $\varphi(x) \mathrm{d}x = \phi(w) \mathrm{d}w$.
